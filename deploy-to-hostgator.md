# Deploy Nalamini to Hostgator (www.nalamini.com)

## Quick Assessment
Your Hostgator shared hosting likely doesn't support full Node.js applications. Here are your best options:

## Option 1: Use Vercel + Custom Domain (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to get your app live on www.nalamini.com:

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to vercel.com and sign up with GitHub
2. Connect this Replit project to GitHub
3. Import the project to Vercel
4. Vercel will automatically deploy it

### Step 2: Point Your Domain
1. In Hostgator cPanel, go to DNS Management
2. Add these DNS records:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   - Type: A
   - Name: @
   - Value: 76.76.19.61

### Step 3: Configure Vercel
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Add custom domain: www.nalamini.com
3. Vercel will provide SSL certificate automatically

## Option 2: Railway + Custom Domain
Similar to Vercel but with better database support:

1. Deploy to Railway.app
2. Connect your database
3. Point your domain DNS to Railway

## Option 3: Traditional Hostgator Upload (Limited)
If you want to use Hostgator directly:

### What You Can Upload:
- Static files only (HTML, CSS, JS)
- No database functionality
- No server-side features

### Steps:
1. Build the project locally
2. Upload `dist` folder contents to public_html
3. Configure .htaccess for routing

## Recommendation
Use Vercel with custom domain pointing. It's:
- Free
- Automatic SSL
- Full database support
- Easy maintenance
- Perfect for your React + Node.js app
