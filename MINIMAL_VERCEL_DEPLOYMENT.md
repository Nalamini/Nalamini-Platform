# Minimal Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step approach for deploying a minimal API to Vercel to verify connectivity and bypass complex build processes.

## The Minimal Approach

After multiple attempts to deploy the full application to Vercel, we've created a minimal deployment approach:

1. A bare-minimum API that requires no dependencies
2. A simplified project structure with only essential files
3. A deployment process that avoids complex build steps

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Use Our Prepared Minimal Deployment

We've created a standalone folder with a minimal deployment:

1. Change to the vercel-deploy directory:
   ```
   cd vercel-deploy
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. Follow the Vercel CLI prompts:
   - Log in when prompted
   - Accept default project settings
   - Confirm deployment

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Vercel Dashboard

1. Create a new project on Vercel:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Select "Import Git Repository" or "Upload"
   - If uploading, zip and upload the vercel-deploy folder

2. Configure project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Root Directory: ./ (or vercel-deploy if using the main repository)
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: ./ (or empty)
   - Install Command: (leave empty)

3. Deploy the project

## After Deployment

Once deployed:

1. Test the API by visiting the URL provided by Vercel
2. You should see a JSON response with status information
3. Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard if needed

## Expanding from the Minimal Deployment

Once you have a successful minimal deployment:

1. Enhance the API functionality
   - Add database connectivity
   - Add authentication endpoints
   - Gradually expand API features

2. Work towards a full deployment strategy
   - Deploy the frontend separately
   - Explore alternative deployment options

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify that no build command is being run
3. Ensure the API file is properly formatted
4. Check that vercel.json is valid JSON

## Next Steps

This minimal deployment is just a starting point. Once you confirm it works:

1. Transfer your actual API routes to this deployment
2. Update the database connection logic
3. Consider a separate approach for the frontend
