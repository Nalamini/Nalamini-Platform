# Quick Fix for Android Studio Indentation Warning

## The Error You're Seeing
The "Indentation setting will affect" message is just a formatting warning - your app will build and run perfectly fine.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Ignore the Warning
- This warning doesn't prevent building or running your app
- Your Nalamini app will work normally
- Proceed with building your release APK

### Option 2: Fix Formatting (30 seconds)
1. **In Android Studio**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+L` (Mac)
2. **Or go to**: Code → Reformat Code
3. **Select**: Whole file
4. **Click**: Run

### Option 3: Adjust Settings
1. **File** → **Settings** → **Editor** → **Code Style**
2. **Set indentation**: 4 spaces
3. **Apply** → **OK**

## Continue Building Your App

**Your next steps remain the same:**
1. **Build** → **Generate Signed Bundle/APK**
2. **Choose**: Android App Bundle
3. **Create keystore** and build
4. **Output**: app-release.aab for Play Store

The indentation warning is cosmetic and won't affect your Nalamini app's functionality or Play Store submission.
