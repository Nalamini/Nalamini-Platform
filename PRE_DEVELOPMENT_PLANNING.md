# Pre-Development Planning Guide

This document outlines the steps to take before starting development on any new feature or making changes to existing ones in the Nalamini Service Platform.

## 1. Define the Feature Requirements

**Questions to ask:**
- What specific problem does this feature solve?
- Who will use this feature (admins, managers, service agents, customers)?
- What are the exact steps a user will take when using this feature?
- What information needs to be displayed, collected, or processed?

**Action items:**
- Write a brief, clear description of the feature
- List all user actions and system responses
- Document any business rules or calculations

## 2. Map the Data Structure

**Questions to ask:**
- What data will this feature need to access or store?
- How does this data relate to existing information in the system?
- Will new database tables or fields be needed?

**Action items:**
- List all data fields needed
- Identify connections to existing data
- Create a simple diagram showing data relationships (if needed)

## 3. Design the User Interface

**Questions to ask:**
- What screens or components will users interact with?
- What is the navigation flow between screens?
- How should information be organized visually?
- How will the feature appear on different device sizes?

**Action items:**
- Sketch simple wireframes of each screen
- Create a flow diagram showing navigation between screens
- Note any specific UI elements needed (forms, tables, charts)

## 4. Plan the Component Structure

**Questions to ask:**
- Can we break this feature into smaller, reusable components?
- Which components will need to share data?
- Can we reuse any existing components?

**Action items:**
- List all components needed
- Draw a simple diagram showing component relationships
- Identify which components should handle which responsibilities

## 5. Identify Potential Challenges

**Questions to ask:**
- What parts of this feature might be difficult to implement?
- Are there any performance concerns?
- Could any part of this feature break existing functionality?
- Are there any security considerations?

**Action items:**
- List potential issues and approaches to address them
- Identify areas that might need extra testing
- Document any assumptions being made

## 6. Create a Testing Checklist

**Questions to ask:**
- How will we know if this feature is working correctly?
- What specific scenarios should be tested?
- How might users try to use this feature incorrectly?

**Action items:**
- Create a checklist of test scenarios
- Include both common usage and edge cases
- Note what success looks like for each test

## 7. Break Down Implementation Steps

**Questions to ask:**
- What is the logical order to build the components?
- Which parts can be built and tested independently?
- What are the dependencies between different parts?

**Action items:**
- Create a numbered list of implementation steps
- Identify logical stopping points where testing can occur
- Estimate time required for each step (if needed)

## 8. Document APIs and Interactions

**Questions to ask:**
- What API endpoints will be needed?
- What data will be sent to and from the server?
- What error conditions need to be handled?

**Action items:**
- List all required API endpoints
- Document request and response formats
- Note error handling approaches

## Example Planning Template

Here's a simple template you can use for each new feature:

```
# [Feature Name] Planning Document

## Feature Description
[Brief description of what the feature does and why it's needed]

## User Flow
1. User navigates to [screen]
2. User sees [information displayed]
3. User takes [action]
4. System responds with [response]
...

## Data Requirements
- Data needed from existing tables: [list fields]
- New data to store: [list fields]
- Data relationships: [describe connections]

## UI Components
- [Component 1]: [purpose and behavior]
- [Component 2]: [purpose and behavior]
...

## API Requirements
- GET /api/[endpoint]: [purpose and response format]
- POST /api/[endpoint]: [purpose and request format]
...

## Potential Challenges
- [Challenge 1]: [possible approach]
- [Challenge 2]: [possible approach]
...

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test scenario 1: [expected outcome]
- [ ] Test scenario 2: [expected outcome]
...

## Implementation Steps
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
...
```

## Conclusion

Taking time for proper planning before development helps prevent many common issues:
- Reduces the need for major revisions
- Ensures features work consistently with the rest of the application
- Makes it easier to divide work into manageable tasks
- Provides clear criteria for when a feature is complete
- Helps identify potential problems before they become actual problems

By following this guide, you can make the development process smoother and more predictable, resulting in higher quality features with fewer frustrations.
