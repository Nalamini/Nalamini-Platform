# Hostgator Deployment Guide for Nalamini.com

## Overview
Your application can be deployed to Hostgator using several methods. Here are the easiest options:

## Option 1: Static Build (Recommended for Hostgator Shared Hosting)

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Access your Hostgator cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to public_html folder
4. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder (after build)
5. Create .htaccess file for proper routing

### Step 3: Database Setup
- Use Hostgator's MySQL databases feature in cPanel
- Import your database schema
- Update connection strings

## Option 2: Node.js Hosting (If Hostgator supports Node.js)

### Requirements Check
- Verify if your Hostgator plan supports Node.js applications
- Check Node.js version compatibility

### Deployment Steps
1. Upload entire project via File Manager or FTP
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start the application

## Option 3: Alternative Hosting Platforms

If Hostgator doesn't support full-stack Node.js applications:

### Vercel (Recommended)
- Free tier available
- Automatic deployments
- Custom domain support (point nalamini.com to Vercel)

### Railway/Render
- Node.js and PostgreSQL support
