# Deployment Options for www.nalamini.com

## Easiest Option: Vercel with Custom Domain

### Why Vercel is Best for Your Case:
- Your Hostgator shared hosting can't run Node.js applications
- Vercel provides free hosting with database support
- You keep your domain name (www.nalamini.com)
- Automatic SSL certificate
- Zero server maintenance

### Simple 3-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Visit vercel.com and sign up
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Import this project from GitHub
4. Vercel automatically builds and deploys

#### Step 2: Update DNS in Hostgator
In your Hostgator cPanel:
1. Go to Zone Editor or DNS Management
2. Delete existing A records for your domain
3. Add these new records:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.19.61
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

#### Step 3: Add Custom Domain in Vercel
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to project settings
2. Add domain: nalamini.com and www.nalamini.com
3. Vercel handles SSL automatically

### Database Setup:
- Use Neon (free PostgreSQL)
- Or upgrade to Vercel's database addon
- Import your existing data

## Alternative: Railway Deployment
If you prefer Railway:
- Similar process to Vercel
- Better for complex databases
- Built-in PostgreSQL included

## Traditional Hostgator Upload (Not Recommended)
- Only supports static files
- No database functionality
- No server-side features
- Complex maintenance
