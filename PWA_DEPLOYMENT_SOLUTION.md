  '/',
  '/static/js/bundle.js',
  '/static/css/main.css',
  '/manifest.json'
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
