# Ultra-Simple Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Nalamini Service Platform to Vercel using an extremely simplified approach to bypass the package.json path issue.

## What's Different About This Approach?

Our ultra-simple deployment approach:

1. Uses a minimal serverless function with no dependencies
2. Skips the build process entirely
3. Avoids any file path issues by not requiring access to package.json
4. Provides a basic API endpoint that confirms the deployment is working

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com)
2. The Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Preparation

We've already created the necessary files:
- `api/index.js` - A minimal serverless function
- `vercel.json` - A configuration file that avoids build steps

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

Run our deployment script:
```
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```

Or manually deploy with:
```
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment:
1. Open the URL provided by Vercel
2. Test the `/api/health` endpoint - it should return a JSON response with "status": "ok"

### 4. Important: This is a Temporary Solution

This approach gets a minimal version of your API deployed to Vercel, but it's meant to be a stepping stone. Once you confirm the deployment works:

1. Add your database connection
2. Gradually expand functionality
3. Eventually move to a more complete deployment with proper build processes

## Common Issues and Solutions

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Access deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. **Verify Function Limits**: Increase memory or duration in vercel.json if needed
3. **API Routes**: All routes under /api/* are handled by api/index.js

## Next Steps

After successful deployment of this minimal version:

1. Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET

2. Gradually expand the API functionality by enhancing api/index.js

3. When ready for a complete deployment, investigate options for properly handling the build process
